<h2>Self Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>As a new, and not very known, web designer, it is important to use any advantage you have to get the word out about your brand.</p>
<p>Social media is a good way to gain traction. linkedin is a great way to gain popularity.</p>
<p>Another way to gain a customer base for my brand is through sites like Youtube. Using videos to show how you did something on a site is a good way to advertise your skills.</p>
